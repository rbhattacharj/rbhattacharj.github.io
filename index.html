<p> Hi! I am a third year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">College of Information and Computer Sciences</a> at University of Massachusetts Amherst. </p> 

<p> I'm a student in the <a href="http://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/">Theoretical Computer Science group</a>. I'm advised by <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/">Prof. Cameron Musco</a>.</p>

<!--<p> Prior to this, I was working as a research assistant at <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a> with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/">Prof. Abhishek Sinha</a> on problems related to online learning and on minimizing the age-of-information of users in a communication network. Even before that, 
I was a research assitant at <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad</a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nareshmanwani/">Prof. Naresh Manwani</a> working on problems in online learning and machine learning.-->
        
        <p>I have a masters' degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/">Indian Statistical Institute</a> and a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/">Jadavpur University</a>, India. 
		You can check out my resume <a href="https://rbhattacharj.github.io/files/Simple_CV.pdf">here</a>.
		<!--In between, I have also worked in the industry as a consultant and as a data scientist.-->

	<h2> Research Interests </h2>
        <p> 
I'm broadly interested in theoretical computer science and machine learning. Specifically I work in the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Randomized Algorithms for problems in Linear Algebra, Graph Theory and Machine Learning. </li>
<li>Online Learning and Optimization. Specifcially, online caching algorithms with sublinear regret and matching lower bounds.  </li>
<li> Designing algorithms with machine-learned advice. </li>
</ul> 
Recently, some fo the problems I've been working on include estimating eignevalues of matrices in sublinear time, online caching algorithms with machine learned advice and 
estimating maximum mathcing in graph streams in sublinear space. 
Previously, I've also worked on online algorithms for minimizing the age-of-information in communicaton networks.
<!--I'm also interested in understanding the tradeoffs between the computational and statistical efficiency of learning algorithms.--> 


<!--I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. My specific interests include the Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Causal Inference and Machine Learning.
