<p> Hi! I am a second year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">College of Information and Computer Sciences</a> at University of Massachusetts Amherst. </p> 

<p> I'm a student in the <a href="http://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/">Theoretical Computer Science group</a>. I'm advised by <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/">Prof. Cameron Musco</a>.</p>

<!--<p> Prior to this, I was working as a research assistant at <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a> with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/">Prof. Abhishek Sinha</a> on problems related to online learning and on minimizing the age-of-information of users in a communication network. Even before that, 
I was a research assitant at <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad</a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nareshmanwani/">Prof. Naresh Manwani</a> working on problems in online learning and machine learning.-->
        
        <p>I have a masters' degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/">Indian Statistical Institute</a> and a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/">Jadavpur University</a>, India.

		<!--In between, I have also worked in the industry as a consultant and as a data scientist.-->

	<h2> Research Interests </h2>
        <p> 
I'm broadly interested in theoretcial computer science (specifically sublinear algorithms for large scale data) and machine learning. In my research, I try to leverage tools from randomized algorithms, linear algebra, optimization and machine learning to design algorithms which can process large scale data efficiently. 
I've recently been working on sublinear time algorithms for problems related to computational linear algebra. I'm currently working on the problem of approximating the eigenspectrum of a matrix in sublinear time by sampling random submatrices.
<!--I'm also interested in understanding the tradeoffs between the computational and statistical efficiency of learning algorithms.--> 


<!--I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. My specific interests include the Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Causal Inference and Machine Learning.

<p>  Previously, I've  worked on online learning, specifically, on finding lower bounds on the regret of online caching. I've also worked on optimizing the age-of-information in communicaton networks.
