<p> Hi! I am a second year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">College of Information and Computer Sciences</a> at University of Massachusetts Amherst. </p> 

<p> I am a part of the <a href="http://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/">Theoretical Computer Science group</a>. I'm advised by <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/">Prof. Cameron Musco</a>.</p>

<p> Prior to this, I was working as a research assistant at <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a> with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/">Prof. Abhishek Sinha</a> on problems related to online learning and on minimizing the age-of-information of users in a communication network. Even before that, 
I was a research assitant at <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad</a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nareshmanwani/">Prof. Naresh Manwani</a> working on problems in online learning and machine learning.
        
        <p> Previously, I completed my masters' degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/">Indian Statistical Institute</a> in 2017 and a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/">Jadavpur University</a> in 2013. In between, I have also worked in the industry as a consultant and as a data scientist.

	<h2> Research Interests </h2>
        <p> 
I'm broadly interested in theoretical computer science and machine learning. I leverage tools from randomized algorithms, linear algebra, optimization and machine learning to design algorithms which can proccess large amounts of data efficiently. 
I'm also interested in understanding the computational and statistical tradeoffs for learning algorithms.

<p> I'm currently working on algorithms which can approximate the eigenspectrum of a matrix in sublinear time.  
Previously, I've  worked on problems related to online learning. You can check out some of my publications below. </p>
