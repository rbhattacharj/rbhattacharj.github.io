<p> I am a fifth year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences</a> at University of Massachusetts Amherst. </p> 

<p> I'm a student in the <a href="http://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/">Theoretical Computer Science group</a>. I'm advised by <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/">Prof. Cameron Musco</a>.</p>

<!--<p> Prior to this, I was working as a research assistant at <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a> with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/">Prof. Abhishek Sinha</a> on problems related to online learning and on minimizing the age-of-information of users in a communication network. Even before that, 
I was a research assitant at <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad</a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nareshmanwani/">Prof. Naresh Manwani</a> working on problems in online learning and machine learning.-->
        
        <p>I have a masters' degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/">Indian Statistical Institute</a> and a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/">Jadavpur University</a>, India.

	<h2> Research Interests </h2>
        <p> 
I am broadly interested in randomized algorithms and machine learning, with a focus on fast algorithms for large data problems. Specifically I work on designing efficient randomized algorithm in the following domains:
<ul>
<li><b>Randomized Algorithms for linear algebraic tasks</b> like spectrum estimation. </li>
<li><b>Online learning</b>, specifically, <i>online caching</i> and <i>resource allocation</i> problems. </li>
<li><b>Algorithmic  fairness</b> and <b>differential privacy</b> preserving algorithms.</li>
</ul> 
Recently, some of the problems I've been working on include algorithms which estimate the spectrum of matrix with a small number of matrix vector multiplications and online algorithms for fair resource allocation. I'm also working on algorithms for <i>fast tensor vector products</i> with applications to fast approximation of the attention layer in transformers and memory efficient computation of the <i>attention layer of transformers</i> using techniques from randomized linear algebra as a part of my internship at Adobe Research.  
<!--I'm also interested in understanding the tradeoffs between the computational and statistical efficiency of learning algorithms.--> 


<!--I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. My specific interests include the Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Causal Inference and Machine Learning.
